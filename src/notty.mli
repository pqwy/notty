(** Declaring terminals.

    Notty is a terminal library that revolves around construction and
    composition of displayable images.

    This module provides the core {{!I}[image]} abstraction, standalone
    {{!Render}rendering}, and escape sequence {{!Unescape}parsing}. It does not
    depend on any platform code, and does not interact with the environment.
    Input and output are provided by {!Notty_unix} and {!Notty_lwt}.

         [k] is either a special {{!key}key}, or [`Uchar u] where [u]

         {{!I.ctrls}control character}, and is safe to use in
         constructing images.

         }
      {- [`Mouse (event, (x, y), mods)] is mouse input.

         [event] is the actual mouse event: {{!button}[button]} press, release,
         or motion of the mouse with buttons depressed.

         [(x, y)] are column and row position of the mouse. The origin is
         [(0,0)], the upper-left corner.

         {b Note} Every [`Press(`Left|`Middle|`Right)] generates a corresponding
         [`Release], but there is no portable way to detect which button was
         released. [`Scroll(`Up|`Down)] presses are not followed by releases. }}

      Terminal input protocols are historical cruft, and heavily overload the
      ASCII range. For instance:
      {ul
      {- It is impossible to distinguish lower- and upper-case ASCII characters
         if {b Ctrl} is pressed;}
      {- several combinations of key-presses are aliased as special keys; and}
      {- in a UTF-8 encoded stream, there is no representation for non-ASCII
         characters with modifier keys.}}

      This means that many values that inhabit the [event] type are impossible,
      while some reflect multiple different user actions. Limitations include:

      {ul
      {- [`Shift] is reported only with special keys, and not all of them.}
      {- [`Meta] and [`Control] are reported with mouse events, key events with
         special keys, and key events with values in the ranges [0x40-0x5f]
         ([@] to [_]) and [0x60-0x7e] ([`] to [~]). If {b Ctrl} is pressed, the higher
         range is mapped into the lower range.}
      {- Terminals will variously under-report modifier key state.}}

    {2:meaning The meaning of images}

    An {{!image}[image]} value is a rectangle of styled character cells. It has a
    width and height, but is not anchored to an origin. A single character with
    associated display attributes, or a short fragment of text, are simple
    examples of images.

    Images are created by combining text fragments with {{!attributes}display
    attributes}, and composed by placing them {{!I.(<|>)}beside} each other,
    {{!I.(<->)}above} each other, and {{!I.(</>)}over} each other.

    Once constructed, an image can be {{!Render.to_string}rendered} and only at
    that point it obtains absolute placement.

    Consult {{!I}[I]} for more details.

    {2:attributes Display attributes}

    {{!attr}[attr]} values describe the styling characteristics of fragments of
    text.

    They combine a foreground and a background {{!A.color}[color]} with a
    set of {{!A.style}[styles]}. Either color can be {e unset}, which corresponds to
    the terminal's default foreground (resp. background) color.

    Attributes are used to construct primitive images.

    Consult {{!A}[A]} for more details.

    {2:ctrls Control characters}

    These are taken to be characters in the ranges [0x00-0x1f] ({b C0}) and
    [0x80-0x9f] ({b C1}), and [0x7f] (BACKSPACE). This is the
    {{: http://unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values}Unicode
    general category} {b Cc}.

    As control characters directly influence the cursor positioning, they
    cannot be used to create images.

    This, in particular, means that images cannot contain [U+000a] (NEWLINE).

    {1:limitations Limitations}

    [Notty] does not use Terminfo. If your terminal is particularly
    idiosyncratic, things might fail to work. Get in touch with the author to
    expand support.

    [Notty] assumes that the terminal is using UTF-8 for input and output.
    Things might break arbitrarily if this is not the case.

    For performance considerations, consult the {{!perf}performance model}.

    {2:cwidth Unicode vs. Text geometry}

    [Notty] uses [Uucp.Break.tty_width_hint] to guess the width of text
    fragments when computing geometry, and it suffers from the same
    shortcomings:

    {ul
    {- Geometry in general works for alphabets and east Asian scripts, mostly
        works for abjad scripts, and is a matter of luck for abugidas.}
    {- East Asian scripts work better when in
        {{:http://unicode.org/glossary/#normalization_form_c}NFC}.}
    {- Emoji tend to be consistent with the actual rendering, and the actual
        rendering tends to be wrong.}}

    When in doubt, see
    {{: http://erratique.ch/software/uucp/doc/Uucp.Break.html#VALtty_width_hint}
    [Uucp.Break.tty_width_hint]}.

    Unicode also has a special interaction with {{!hcrop}horizontal cropping}:
    {ul
    {- Strings within images are cropped at {{:
        http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries}grapheme
        cluster} boundaries. This means that scalar value sequences that are
        rendered combined, or overlaid, stay unbroken.}
    {- When a crop splits a wide character in two, the remaining half is
        replaced by [U+0020] (SPACE). Hence, character-cell-accurate cropping is
        possible even in the presence of characters that horizontally occupy
        more than one cell.}}

    {2 Pretty-printing}

    Pretty-printing into an [image]:

    {[I.strf ~attr:A.(fg green) "(%d)" 42 |> output_image_endline]}

    Decorated pretty-printers:

{[
let pp = Format.pp_print_int |> I.pp_attr A.(fg green) in
I.strf "(%a)" pp 43 |> output_image_endline
]}

    {2 Taking terminal size into account}

    Space a line end-to-end horizontally:

{[
Notty_unix.output_image_size @@ fun (w, _) ->
  let i1 = I.string A.(fg green) "very"
  and i2 = I.string A.(fg yellow) "melon" in
  I.(i1 <|> void (w - width i1 - width i2) 1 <|> i2)
]}

    Print a triangle that fits into the terminal:

{[
Notty_unix.output_image_size @@ fun (w, _) ->
  let steps = int_of_float ((log (float w)) /. log 2.) in
  sierp steps |> I.vpad 0 1
]}

    {2 Simple interaction}

    Interactive Sierpinski:
{[
open Notty_unix

let img (double, n) =
  let s = sierp n in
  if double then I.(s </> hpad 1 0 s) else s in
let rec update t state =
  Term.image t (img state); loop t state
and loop t (double, n as state) =
  match Term.event t with
  | `Key (`Enter,_)        -> ()
  | `Key (`Arrow `Left,_)  -> update t (double, max 1 (n - 1))
  | `Key (`Arrow `Right,_) -> update t (double, min 8 (n + 1))
  | `Key (`Uchar 0x20,_)   -> update t (not double, n)
  | `Resize _              -> update t state
  | _                      -> loop t state
in
let t = Term.create () in
update t (false, 1);
Term.release t
]}

    The program uses a fullscreen {{!Notty_unix.Term}terminal} and loops reading
    the {{!Notty_unix.Term.event}input}. LEFT and RIGHT control the iteration
    count, and SPACE toggles double-drawing. Resizing the window causes a
    redraw. When the loop exits on ENTER, the terminal is
    {{!Notty_unix.Term.release}cleaned up}.

    {1:perf Performance model}

    This section is only relevant if using [Notty] becomes your bottleneck.

    {b TL;DR} Shared sub-expressions do not share work, so operators stick with
    you.

    The main performance parameter is {e image complexity}. This roughly
    corresponds to the number of image {{!I.imgcomp}composition} and
    {{!I.imgcrop}cropping} operators in the fully expanded [image] term,
    {b ignoring all sharing}.

    Outline numbers:

    {ul
    {- Highly complex images can be rendered and pushed out to a full-screen
       terminal more than 1000 times per second.}
    {- With more realistic images, this number is closer to 30,000.}
    {- Input processing is somewhere around 50MB/s.}}


    Image complexity [cplx] of an image [i] is:
    {ul
    {- For a {{!I.imgprims}primitive} [i], [cplx i = 1].}
    {- For a {{!I.imgcomp}composition} operator [op],
       [cplx (op i1 i2) = 1 + cplx i1 + cplx i2].}
    {- For a {{!I.imgcomp}crop} [cr],
       [cplx (cr i1) = 1 + cplx i1 - k], where [k] is the combined complexity of
       all the {e maximal} sub-terms that do not contribute to the output.}}

    For example (assuming an image [i]):

{[
  let img1 = I.((i <|> i) <-> (i <|> i))
  let img2 = I.(let x = i <|> i in x <-> x)
  let img3 = I.(((i <|> i) <|> i) <|> i)
]}

    Complexity of each of these is [4 * cplx i + 3]. This might be surprising
    for [img2].

    If [width i = 1], [cplx (hcrop 1 0 img1) = 3 + 2 * cplx i], and
    [cplx (hcrop 2 0 img3) = 2 + 2 * cplx i].

    While [Notty] strives to be accommodating to all usage scenarios, these are
    the things to keep in mind if the rendering becomes slow:

    {ol
    {- Image composition is cheap.

       Combining images performs a negligible amount of computation.

       Constructing primitive images that contain scalar values outside of the
       ASCII range does a little more work upfront and is worth holding onto.

       }
    {- {{!Render}Rendering} depends on image complexity.

       As a consequence, this real-world example of wrapping renders in time
       O(n{^ 2}) in the number of lines:

{[
let wrap1 width img =
  let rec go img = img ::
    if I.width img > width then go (I.hcrop width 0 img) else []
  in go img |> I.vcat |> I.hsnap ~align:`Left width
]}

       Although [crop] is applied only [lines] times, the image complexity of
       each line depends on the number of preceding lines.

       An O(n) version does not iterate [crop]:

{[
let wrap2 width img =
  let rec go off = I.hcrop off 0 img ::
    if I.width img - off > width then go (off + width) else []
  in go 0 |> I.vcat |> I.hsnap ~align:`Left width
]}
       }
    {- Rendering depends on the {e output} dimensions, but not on the {e image}
       dimensions.

       Rendering an image to [w * h] implicitly crops it to its leftmost [w]
       columns and topmost [h] rows. While [w] and [h] will have an impact on
       the rendering performance, the complexity of the (cropped) image tends to
       be more important.}}
